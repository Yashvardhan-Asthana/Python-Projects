# Python-Projects

This repository contains Python projects that involve various programming concepts and applications. Each project is organized into its own subfolder, containing all the necessary files to understand and run the project code.

## How to Run the Projects

Each project folder contains two files:
1. `README.txt` – Provides an overview of the project and detailed steps on how to execute the code.
2. Python code file (`.py`) – The main Python file containing the source code.

### Steps to Run:
1. Navigate to the specific project's folder.
2. Open the `README.txt` file for instructions.
3. Copy the contents of the Python code file (e.g., `ast_engine.py` or `weather_monitoring.py`) and paste it into your preferred Python IDE or editor.
4. Ensure that Python is installed on your system, along with any required libraries or modules, and then run the Python script.

## Projects

Currently, the repository contains the following two projects:

### 1. AST_Engine
The `AST-_Engine` project demonstrates the use of Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) in Python for creating, combining, and evaluating rules. The rules are parsed using an AST engine built with data structures, including a 'Node' structure, and evaluated against the provided input.

### 2. Weather_Monitoring
The `Weather-Monitoring` project enables users to monitor the weather conditions of six major Indian metro cities by fetching real-time data from an external API.
